# server-monitor
Simple server-room monitor using Arduino with Ethernet shield
This design uses split-coil transformers for current consumption monitoring and in addition to checking for power loss, can detect any outage that causes a server to stop drawing current. Also monitors a Hall effect sensor for door open/close in addition to temperature monitoring.
